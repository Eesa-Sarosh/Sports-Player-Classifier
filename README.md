# Sports-Player-Classifier

## Description
This Jupyter notebook contains Python scripts for a sports player classifier using image processing techniques. The project utilizes Haar cascades for eye detection and wavelet transforms to extract features from images. Key libraries used include numpy, cv2 (OpenCV), matplotlib, selenium, and requests.

## Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The following libraries are required:
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Matplotlib
- Selenium
- Requests

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib selenium requests


## Features

1. Image Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for image-related operations, including wavelet transform for feature extraction and eye detection using Haar cascades.

2. Web Scraping with Selenium: Implements Selenium for automated web browsing to gather images from the web. This section likely involves navigating web pages, extracting image URLs, and downloading images for training the classifier.

3. *dditional Utilities: The notebook might contain additional utility functions or code snippets for handling files, directories, or performing other miscellaneous tasks related to the sports player classification.

## Usage
Each cell in the notebook is designed to perform a specific task. Run the cells in sequence to ensure all dependencies and context are correctly established.

## Note
- The notebook might require specific file paths or external resources like Haar cascade XML files for eye detection and trained models for classification.
- Ensure you have the necessary drivers for Selenium to interact with web browsers.
